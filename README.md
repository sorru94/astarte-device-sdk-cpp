# Astarte device SDK for C++

This repo contains an implementation of an Astarte device SDK for C++.

> **N.B.** At the current state this SDK only provides connectivity to Astarte through the [Astarte message hub](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-message-hub).

## Minimum C++ version

This library requires at least C++ 20.

## Supported Astarte message hub versions

This library relies on the Astarte message hub for connectivity with Astarte. The message hub should be at least at version 0.8.0 for this library to function properly.

## Formatting Astarte data

Astarte data, both in transmission and reception is encapsulated in C++ objects. It is possible to pretty print data objects. The resulting string will be in a JSON compabile format and can be used to interact with the Astarte REST APIs during developement.

## Optional features

Some features of the library can be enabled or disabled using CMake options.

### Public spdlog dependency

The spdlog libary is the logger used by the Astarte device library. By the default it's a private dependency, checked our with fetch content. However, the user can choose to link the library as a public dependency using the dedicated option `ASTARTE_PUBLIC_SPDLOG_DEP`.

### Public message hub proto dependency

The [Astarte message hub proto](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-message-hub-proto) is a separate CMake project that contains the protobuffer definitions of the gRPC used by this library to connect with the Astarte message hub. This feature makes the Astarte message hub proto project a public dependency of this library. The user can subsequently access the gRPC stubs directly from within C++ code.

The option to enable this feature is: `ASTARTE_PUBLIC_PROTO_DEP`.

> **N.B.** This option should only be enabled during developement.

## Dependencies

For this library to work properly some dependencies are required. All of them can be imported directly by the library using fetch content. However, the user may choose to use system installed ones setting some cmake options.

### gRPC

The most importand and large depencency for this library is [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc). The officially supported version of gRPC is `v1.72.0`, but any gRPC recent version should work just fine.

By default gRPC will be imported using FetchContent. Users can choose to use their system gRPC by setting the CMake option `ASTARTE_USE_SYSTEM_GRPC`.

> **N.B.** Importing gRPC with FetchContent requires a re-compilation of the gRPC library leading to a much longer build time. We suggest using your system gRPC for fast developement.

### Astarte message hub proto

The [Astarte message hub proto](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte-message-hub-proto) is a separate project that contains the protobuffer definitions of the gRPC used by this library to connect with the Astarte message hub. This dependency is imported using fetch content and it's necessary for the proper functioning of the library.

By default the Astarte message hub protos will be imported using FetchContent. Users can choose to use a local checkout of the repository by setting the CMake option `ASTARTE_MESSAGE_HUB_PROTO_DIR` to the appropriate directory.

### spdlog

This library uses [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) to log information. The logging utility is imported using FetchContent and is an essential component of this library.

By default spdlog will be imported using FetchContent. Users can choose to use a local installation by setting the CMake option `ASTARTE_USE_SYSTEM_SPDLOG`.

## Get started with the samples

Various samples have been added in the `samples` folder of this project. An utility bash script has also been added, named `build_sample.sh`. It can be used to build one of the samples without having to deal directly with CMake.

## Importing the library in an external project

This library supports CMake as the default build system. It can be imported adding the following lines to your application CMakeList file.

```CMake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    astarte_device_sdk
  GIT_REPOSITORY git@github.com:secomind/astarte-device-sdk-cpp.git
  GIT_TAG v0.8.0
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(astarte_device_sdk)
```

Additionally remember to link the library with your executable.
```CMake
target_link_libraries(app
    PRIVATE astarte_device_sdk)
```

## Conan integration

The package manager [Conan](https://conan.io/) is supported by this library. This package has not yet been added to the Conan center index and subsequently it's not yet available using the dependency import in a conanfile. However, users can always install into their local cache by checking out this repository and then running the following commands.

```bash
conan create . --build=missing --settings=compiler.cppstd=20
```

The created package can then be added to the conanfile of a project.
```toml
[requires]
astarte-device-sdk/0.8.0
```

Additionally remember to import and link the library with your executable.
```CMake
find_package(astarte_device_sdk)
...
target_link_libraries(app
    PRIVATE astarte_device_sdk::astarte_device_sdk)
```
